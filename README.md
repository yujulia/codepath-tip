Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] After an extended period of time, clear the state.
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.
* [ ] Add a light/dark color theme to the settings view. In viewWillAppear, update views with the correct theme colors.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Changed the tint of all the defaults
- [x] Staggered animations - animate on completion of another animation
- [x] Only animate if there is a bill amount
- [x] Added clear to bill amount
- [x] Not sure if this is intended behavior but upon updating the default tip percent, going back to the main view will update the tip to that default since why elese would you be updating the default?
- [x] Set the bounds based on view size so its centered in other device sizes 5+
